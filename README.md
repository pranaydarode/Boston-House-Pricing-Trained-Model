Housing Price Prediction Model


Overview:-

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting housing prices based on historical data. Whether you‚Äôre a real estate enthusiast, a data scientist, or just curious about housing trends, this project provides valuable insights and predictive capabilities.

Features:-

Data Exploration: Dive into the dataset to understand its structure, features, and any potential correlations.

Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.

Model Selection: Implement various regression models (such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree) to predict housing prices.
Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error).
Visualization: Create visualizations to showcase trends, feature importance, and predictions.
Deployment (Optional): If applicable, deploy the model for real-time predictions.

Dataset:-

The dataset used in this project includes historical information on housing prices. You can find it in the data directory. Feel free to explore and analyze the data to gain insights.
